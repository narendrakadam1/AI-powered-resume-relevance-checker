Orchid College of Engineering & Technology, Solapur. I have consistently maintained strong academic performance, while building a solid technical foundation.\n\nI completed my HSC from Kendriya Vidyalaya Central Railways, Solapur, with a focus on science and mathematics. Prior to that, I passed my SSC from Kendriya Vidyalaya, C.R. Solapur, where I first discovered my interest in computers and logical thinking.\n\nAs part of my coursework, I have studied core subjects such as Data Structures, Operating Systems, DBMS, and Web Technologies. I have completed a mini project titled "Bus Time Management System" and am currently working on my third-year project, "Agentic Browser," which aims to automate browsing tasks using AI agents. I have contributed to both frontend and backend development, as well as documentation and team coordination for these projects.\n\nIn addition to academics, I have participated in national-level hackathons, where my team and I won 4th prize, as well as various coding contests. I have also taken part in college and district level chess tournaments, securing 1st and 2nd positions, respectively.\n\nOutside the classroom, I am actively engaged in extra-curricular activities. I have completed world-renowned, human-based study programs under Art of Living, which focus on mental, emotional, and psychological development. Furthermore, I enjoy mentoring and gathering potential juniors to collaborate on ambitious projects, such as building drones and creating an agent-based, lightweight operating system. These experiences have greatly enhanced my communication, leadership, and teamwork skills.\n\nMy short-term goal is to join a growth-oriented organization where I can apply my technical knowledge, learn from industry experts, and contribute meaningfully to team projects. In the long term, I aspire to become a specialist in cybersecurity and operating systems, and eventually grow into a leadership role where I can contribute to innovative solutions for real-world problems.\n\nI am confident that my technical skills, strong academic background, and proactive attitude will enable me to excel in a professional environment.\n\nThank you for the opportunity.\n\n\x0c', 'structured_data': 'Here is the extracted information from Narendra Ravindranath Kadam\'s resume, structured in a clear format:\n\n**Personal Information**\n\n* Name: Narendra Ravindranath Kadam\n* Age: Not specified (third-year student)\n* Current Institution: N.K.
